		    <em> Student, Algorithms Engineer </em>
		    <p>
			Through EECS 452 (Digital Signal Processing), I worked on a project that processes drum kit audio inputs and classifies them in real time, creating sheet music as it processes inputs. This sheet music includes properly quantized inputs based off of probabalistic priors for common beats (putting an empahsis on eigth and quarter notes over 16th notes, etc).		    </p>
		    <p>
		    The project uses an STM Nucleo DSP chip to process and classify the input drum hits using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF). Once the Nucleo correctly classifies drum hits by their title (snare, hi-hat closed, tom, crash, etc), the system then sends the onsets via UART to a raspberry pi. The Raspberry Pi then "transcribes" the input using known beat priors based off this <a href="">paper.</a> After determining the correct output, the system generates sheet music using the <a href="">Guido Music Notation Framework.</a> The project is currently ongoing, and will demo at the <a href="">Design Expo</a> on December 5th.

		    </p>
		    <p>
			We pose two methods to construct a 3D point cloud of an object given a set of images of said object at various angles around it. This concept is called structure from motion, and we would like to implement a basic version of it for small objects in a confined space. We will do this by generating a 3D cloud from the relationship between the camera’s intrinsic parameters and the world’s extrinsic
			parameters. The first method involves creating disparity maps between stereo images to make dense clouds and the second method involves using epipolar lines and feature extraction to create sparse, more accurate 3D clouds.

	    In the EECS 351 Digital Signal Processing Class, we had a final term project where we got a chance to use the signal processing techniques learned in class on a project we designed and tested. For this project, I tried to extend previous work on the MAX MSP <a href="#space_knobs">Vocal Harmonizer</a> from the Michigan Project Music Makeathon.

	    Rather than using MAX MSP, we used MATLAB and were able to develop our own pitch shifting algorithm using the work from other papers such as Jean LaRoche's <a href ="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/LaroD99-pvoc.pdf" target="_blank_">New Phase-Vocoder Techniques for Pitch Shifting, Harmonizing and Other Exotic Effects</a>. Using this, we attempt to create a real-time solution that can take input melodies and MIDI notes to create harmonies! We outline our initial work on our website <a href ="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/eecs351vocalharmonizer/home" target="_blank">here</a>, yet more work is currently being done to port this project into a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) so that it can be used in professional audio workstations by anyone just by dragging and dropping a file. <a href ="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/eecs351vocalharmonizer/home" target="_blank">learn more</a>

While just a prototype built in 3 weeks, we wanted to try and design something that could actually be useful in a scenario where someone eldery  may need more assistance in a home, without having to carry potentially heavy objects. Buddy bot follows an IR-emitting anklet strapped around one's ankle. We used the Smartfusion SoC with an onboard FGPA and a ARM Cortex-M3 processor.

                The goal of Maestro 2018 is to build a virtual conducting system for the University of Michigan’s School of Music, Theatre, and Dance to assist new conductors in practicing their art. Traditionally, new conductors attend active classes where an instructor watches them conduct and provides feedback. To practice outside the classroom, they either practice silently in front of a mirror or must recruit the help of musicians. With Maestro, conductors practice with a computer-simulated ensemble, thereby eliminating the need for live musicians as well as the stress that comes with performing in front of them. New conducting students would use this system in tandem with a traditional classroom experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of my work involved data collection of various music conductors gestures at various dynamic levels(loudness), articulation(style of sound), and tempos(beats per minute). Using this data of almost 14 conductors, I helped design signal processing algorithms to interpret those gestures using an Inertial Measurement Unit that measures rotation, acceleration, and gyroscope data.
                My work involved using Matlab and Python/Pandas to write data analysis and apply transforms on sampled data. Later on, I worked on integrating the system to the Apple ecosystem, converting the algorithms into real-time using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">swift </a>to be processed using an Apple iPhone's IMU and a Mac computer for sound synthesis.

                The project was conducted through the univeristy's <a href ="http://mdp.engin.umich.edu" target="_blank">Multidisciplinary Design Program</a>, a program designed to give students a chance to work on teams of people from various backgrounds, give technical presentations, papers, and work with a sponsor(in our case <a href="http://www.music.umd.edu/faculty/music_directory/wind_and_percussion/andrea_brown" target="_blank">Dr. Andrea Brown</a>) and their varying needs.

                I worked on a live vocal harmonization tool, controlled by knobs(whose data was recorded on potentiometers connected to an arduino). Each knob is mapped to a "voice", and quantized to a specified scale(major, minor, blues, etc) and as you sing into the microphone "replicas" of your voice are generated using an algorithm used to mimic <a href = "https://valhalladsp.com/2010/05/04/pitch-shifters-pre-digital/" target="_blank">tape deck shifting.</a> The program was written in Max/MSP, and allowed for input through either the knobs or also an optional MIDI controller you could plug in to input notes similar to Jacob Collier and Snarky Puppy in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqY3FaZmh-Y" target="_blank">"Don't You Know".</a> You can see a video of the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/199zMmxAI92PQ5OKx_1Ea10NsmFwec0MC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here.</a>

You can see a picture of a 3D model of my shoe using this method to the left. Throughout the class, I experimented with printing static models such as a turtle as well as dynamic "moving parts" using gears, including a basic door hinge. You can print those models <a href ="files/door_latch.zip" target="_blank">here.</a>

            <em>Electronics Engineer</em>
            <p>
                As a part of the Engineering 100 class at the University, me and a a group of fellow engineers were tasked with the creation of an underwater ROV that had a remote control system, a bluetooth camera module, and a hook to allow for interaction with its surroundings. After one semester of work we designed, built and tested the ROV in preparation for a competition at the end of the semester, where we pitted our ROV against other groups in a design challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My contribution to the team was to use Arduinos and RF transmitters/receivers to build a remote control and bluetooth camera system allowed complete control and vision of the underwater ROV, and help build the final product using PVC. Through the class, I learned technical communication skills and how to write technical reports. A detailed technical report of this project can be found <a href="files/rov_report.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a>
